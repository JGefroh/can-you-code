# can-you-code
A collection of potential technical interview challenges to determine whether an interviewee can code.

# Purpose
The purpose is to see if junior-level interview candidates can develop software. From my experience, whiteboard brain teasers and challenges aren't indicative of this. Take-home projects have their own share of problems (lack of time, no control, etc.)

### Challenge Criteria
1. Short challenges - 10-30 minutes.
2. End result is code.
3. Challenges are done in an environment with the tools they will have on their job (computer, google, etc.)

# Challenges
1. [Active Directory Search Base Creator](https://gist.github.com/JGefroh/04872f8648b7712051b2)  
The challenge is to create a class that takes an email address and creates a naive search base for an AD login.  
This has the side effect of testing whether the candidate can do some minor research on their own.
Extra points if they create tests and handle edge cases.

2. [The Number Game](https://gist.github.com/JGefroh/111fc6ca61db239ddd54)  
The challenge is to refactor this code and make it cleaner and better.
